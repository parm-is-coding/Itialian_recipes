            <ul class = "shifted">
               <li>2 cups milk</li>
               <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
               <li>4 egg yolks</li>
               <li> 1/2 Cup Sugar</li>      
            </ul>
            <ol>
               <li>Mix milk and cream in a medium saucepan. Warm until foam forms around the edges. Remove from heat.</li>
               <li>Beat egg yolks and sugar until frothy in a large bowl. Gradually pour the warm milk into egg yolks and sugar, whisking constantly. Return mixture to saucepan; cook over medium heat, stirring with a wooden spoon until the mixture gels slightly and coats the back of the spoon. If small egg lumps begin to show, remove from heat immediately.</li>
               <li>Pour the mixture through a sieve or fine strainer into a bowl. Cover, and chill for several hours or overnight.</li>
               <li>Pour the mixture into an ice cream maker, and freeze according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfer to a sealed container, and freeze until firm. If the gelato is too firm, place it in the refrigerator until it reaches the desired consistency.</li>
